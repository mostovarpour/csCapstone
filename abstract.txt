With the continued advances in space exploration the need to efficiently process the large quantity of data that is received from space continues to grow exponentially. One important piece of data is the massive images of other planets, usually several thousand to several million pixels in size. The current methods of viewing these images is by either building pyramids which can often take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days or by creating tiles for images which can often take just as long. Building pyramids also takes up a massive amount of diks space. We plan on providing researchers with both a method of quickly viewing these images and a tool to view the images in. The method we will provide them is a stochastic sampling algorithm and the tool will be a lightweight image viewer. Our image sampling method, combined with our image viewer will provide researchers the ability to view these massive images in a manner of minutes instead of hours.
