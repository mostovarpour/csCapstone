With continued advances in space exploration, the need to efficiently process the large quantity of data received from space continues to grow exponentially. One important piece of data is the massive images of other planets, usually several thousand to several million pixels in size. The current methods of viewing these images is by either building pyramids or by creating tiles which can often take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days.  Building pyramids also consumes a massive amount of disk space. We plan to provide researchers with a method of quickly viewing these images and a tool in which to view the images. The method we will provide is a stochastic sampling algorithm and the tool will be a lightweight image viewer. Our image sampling method, combined with our image viewer, will provide researchers the ability to view these massive images in a manner of minutes instead of hours.
