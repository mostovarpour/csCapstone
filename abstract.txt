With the continued advances in space exploration 
the need to efficiently process the large quantity 
of data that is received from space continues to 
grow exponentially. One important piece of data is 
the extremely large pictures of other planets, 
usually gigapixels in size. The current method of 
viewing these images is by building pyramids which 
can often take more than eight hours. We plan on 
providing researchers with a tool that will allow 
them to quickly view these images 
with a stochastic sampling algorithm.This would 
give them the ability to view these massive images 
in a manner of minutes instead of hours.
