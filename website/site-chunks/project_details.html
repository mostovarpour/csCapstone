<h2>Project Details</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A gigapixel image is composed of one billion pixels.</li>
    <li>That is 1000 times the image data captured by a 1 megapixel camera.</li>
    <li>For this project we are going to develop a way to quickly and accurately view</li>
    <li>very large images without losing clarity or taking a very long time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Improve on the performance and flexibility of the sampling process.</li>
    <li>Develop a method to quickly view images while enhancing quality in the background.</li>
    <li>Create a product that is able to interact with GDAL.</li>
    <li>Develop a cross-platform viewer that can quickly view images but still retains functionality.</li>
</ul>
<h3>High-Level Design</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Our main design goal is to create an image viewer (most likely using C) that will</li>
    <li>be able to view very large images in a very short amount of time.</li>
    <li>If we are able to develop an efficient reader then we will also develop our own image viewer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
    <li>GDAL</li>
    <li>TuiView</li>
    <li>BGFX</li>
    <li>C/C++/Python/OpenGL</li>
</ul>
