Slides:
    -Don't start with our project start with the problem
    -Start with the problem and than think "Why is this an important problem"
    -Needs more images, replace images that represent ideas instead of using text
    -Dr. Palmer likes the math idea there is just too many words part
        -Try to make it just 3 or 4 lines and then we talk about the commentary
    -Do not mention stochastic sampling until we say what it is
    -After the average downsampling slide talk about how stochastic sampling 
    -GDAL slide should be one of the goals at the very beginning
        -Should not go too much into depth about what GDAL is but still need to 
         explain what it is
    -Need a problem statement
    -Google open source gant chart
    -Do not say that we are working on a GUI, say that we are working on 
     a real-time version of the algorithm, should be part of problem statement
    -We have two main problems, the real-time interactive version and the 
     non interactive version
    -Take a cue for GDAL from the official GDAL website
    -GDAL is the swiss army knife of reading and manipulating rastor and image data
    -Emphasize that GDAL is what everybody uses
        -Used by Google maps, NASA, USGS, anyone who uses 
    -Good conclusion slide
        -Have an image on final slide
        -Make it a cool one
        -Conclusion should mostly summarize the motivation
            -What was problem question
            -How are we going to solve it
            -Convince everyone how marvalous what we are going to do is and 
             how it will solve world hunger
