- Talk about our three major points
    - Tuning last year's project
    - Reducing current sampling times?
    - building a more useable gui?

    - Probably put these at the beginning of the presentation

- Get rid of the pyramid sampling slide
- Get rid of the white slide with the comic on it (I already did this)
- Talk about random sampling more
- Discuss requirements aquisition
    - Go into a medium amount of detail about this
- be more clear
- memorize lines, no note cards
- Dr. Vanderburg liked that we corrected eachother to provide the correct information
- Maybe a little bit more about requirements

- Don't waste any space on slides but don't clutter them either
- Include more concrete points, also need to explain things more
- Really need to talk about requirements more
- need to add something during winter break for the schedule
- Make sure that what we say matches what is on the slide

- talk about project scope
    - seperate the big issue into several smaller issues

- Possibly introduce ourselves at the beginning of the presentation and our job titles
