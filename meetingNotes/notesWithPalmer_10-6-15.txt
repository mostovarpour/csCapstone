Palmer made sure we talked with trent

Wants us to communicate with Austin and Alex

Possibly use tuiview or build off the last team's gui

Difficulty with making the system run on windows

We should look into BGFX. A cross platform graphics api that we may be able to use for making a 
cross platform gui.

PART 1
  Make a Gui
PART 2
  Get the reader into GDAL

Possibly after implementing the reader in gdal, tuiview may just work.

May be easier to start the gui from scratch since tuiview is not built to up the resolution while idle

GUI
READER
Different techniques for reading images.

Smart sampling. If values are similar, chances are we are done sampling
If values are crazy, then we should sample more.

TODO
Go over the old code base that we have to start with.
Create gui with BGFX.
Implement this code inside of GDAL.

Get some proof of concepts done by the end of this semester to make sure that it's doable and we
will then have a base for real production code next semester.

Think scrum and agile.
Tools for scrum and agile. (Trello)
Using C allows us to integrate with python later on.

Right now, get to know GDAL and our current codebase.
